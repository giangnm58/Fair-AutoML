# Fair-AutoML
Fair-AutoML is an extension of Auto-Sklearn, which is used to repair fairness bugs.

* The source code of this work is built on top Auto-Sklearn.
* To reproduce the results, run files in the "evaluation" folder. Each file contains the dataset, buggy models, and the pruned search space. The name of each file represents "dataset + ML algorithm + fairness metric."
* The dataset can be found in the "dataset" folder.
